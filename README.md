# This repository is for the demonstration and display of my Zillow Regression project.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project are to construct a machine learning Regression model that predicts tax assessed values of single-family properties using their attributes and determine key drivers of said values. I will deliver a report for the data science team to read through, replicate, and understand so that they know what steps were taken and why and what the outcome was. I will also make recommendations on what does and/ or does not work for home value predictions.

## Project Description
We want to be able to predict the property tax assessed values of single-family properties that had a transaction during 2017. In this project, we will analyze attributes of single-family properties and develop a model to predict property tax assessed values. Deliverables are a github repository that includes the necessary files and instructions to reproduce my work as well as a final report, and a live presentation in which I present and walk through the final report for the data science team.

## Steps to Reproduce
Clone this repository and copy personal env.py into repo to run (personal valid credentials necessary). Libraries used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

## Initial Questions
1. Why do some properties have a much higher value than others when they are located so close to each other?
2. Why are some properties valued so differently than others when they have nearly the same physical attributes but only differ in location?
3. Is having one bathroom worse than having two bedrooms?
4. What are my best features?

## The Plan

### Wrangle

* Write modules with functions that acquire, prepare and split the data. 
    * Import modules into notebook and test functions
    * Document individual reasons for data prep

### Explore

* explore through visualizations and statistical testing
* summarize findings

### Modeling

### Select evaluation metric
* clearly explain how models were evaluated and compared
    * what metrics did I use and why?

### Evaluate baseline
* I am using the mean property value as a baseline

### Develop 3 models

### Evaluate on train data set

### Evaluate on validate data set

### Evaluate top model on test data set

### Report
