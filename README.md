# This repository is for the demonstration and display of my Zillow Regression project.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project are to construct a machine learning Regression model that predicts tax assessed values of single-family properties using their attributes and determine key drivers of said values. I will deliver a report for the data science team to read through, replicate, and understand so that they know what steps were taken and why and what the outcome was. I will also make recommendations on what does and/ or does not work for home value predictions.

## Project Description
We want to be able to predict the property tax assessed values of single-family properties that had a transaction during 2017. In this project, we will analyze attributes of single-family properties and develop a model to predict property tax assessed values. Deliverables are a github repository that includes the necessary files and instructions to reproduce my work as well as a final report, and a live presentation in which I present and walk through the final report for the data science team.

## Steps to Reproduce
Clone this repository and copy personal env.py into repo to run (personal valid credentials necessary). Libraries used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

## The Plan

### Wrangle

* Write modules with functions that acquire, prepare and split the data. 
    * Import modules into notebook and test functions
    * Document individual reasons for data prep

### Explore

* explore through visualizations and statistical testing
* summarize findings

### Modeling

### Select evaluation metric
* clearly explain how models were evaluated and compared
    * what metrics did I use and why?

### Evaluate baseline
* I am using the mean property value as a baseline

### Develop 3 models

### Evaluate on train data set

### Evaluate on validate data set

### Evaluate top model on test data set

### Report
